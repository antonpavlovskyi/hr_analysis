- matplotlib
- pandas
- seaborn
- scipi
- pylab

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Using the anonymous dataset from a real company I wanted to answer the following questions using different statistical tools:

1. What are the main statistical characteristics of the applicable variables of the dataset in question?
2. What are the relations between different variables?
3. Which factors are most and least correlated.
4. What is the salary distribution overall and in different departments separately?
5. Do employees with high salary spend more time at work then the ones with lower salary?
6. What are the key indicators between employees who quit and the ones who didn't?
7. Build an LDA (Linear discriminant analysis) model that determines whether an employee quits or not based on available factors.
